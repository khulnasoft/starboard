# Roadmap

Initially we want to get feedback from the community about the Starboard approach before we define a roadmap, but some
high-level ideas we would like to address include:

* Release Starboard operator to automatically run reports as resources are created
* Summarizing security issues at the namespace level
* Scale: supporting large amounts of security report data may become an issue
