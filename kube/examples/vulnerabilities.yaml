    - description: An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash
        through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not
        equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID
        to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems
        that support "saved UID" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker
        with command execution in the shell can use "enable -f" for runtime loading
        of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore
        regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are
        unaffected.

        execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution
        to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.
        The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will
        be executed with this corrupted data.

        that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num'

        execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution
        to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred.
        The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will
        be executed with this corrupted data.

        in RFC3490 Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible

        domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded
        Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode
        label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.
